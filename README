This is my attempt at evaluating scratch-off ticket expected value
in the Michigan State lottery. The lottery board publishes the 
remaining prizes left unclaimed, and the approximate "probability"
of holding a winning ticket. If we assume that their estimates
are correct, we can infer the total number of tickets remaining,
and calculate the expected return for each ticket based on the
total unclaimed prizepool that remains. Hopefully at some point
I'll figure out how to scrape the lotto site for this data,
maybe I'll use some sort of wget/curl/shell script thing for that
until then.
